# Cryptocurrencies
Module 18

## Overview
Accountability Accounting (an investment bank) is looking at offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio.  They want to determine what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system.


## Results
- Deliverable 1:  Preprocessing the Data for PCA
    - Created: crypto_clustering.ipynb
    - Data: crypto_data.csv
    - Cleaned and scaled the dataset

- Deliverable 2:  Reducing Data Dimensions using PCA
    - Reduced data to 3 principal components
    - Created a DataFrame with the results

- Deliverable 3:  Clustering Cryptocurrencies using K-means
    - Created an Elbow Curve to determine beset value for K
    INSERT elbow image
    - Ran the K-means model using K=4 and created predictions
    - Created a DataFrame with the results

- Deliverable 4:  Visualizing Crypto Results
    - Created a 3D Scatter Plot with PCA results
    INSERT 3DScatter image
    - Created a table with PCA results
    INSERT table image
    - Scaled data and created a 2D Scatter Plot
    INSERT 2DScatter image




## Summary
This was an exercise in using PCA and K-means clusters to learn about the dataset
